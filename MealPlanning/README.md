2 prongs - 

one is a meal planning tool: they have the week laid out in front of them, with an assumed 3 meals per day. Based on tags they can add trader recipes in each slot and it will auto populate a grocery list for them for the week with the estimated cost. Can also show them what their dietary intake would be daily or weekly. 

other prong, based on tags or certain ingredients or filtering out allergens etc., the tool will recommend a recipe.
