IN PROGRESS: Proposed Idea (2 Functionalities) - 

1) Meal Planning Tool: User has a skeleton of the week laid out in front of them, with an assumed 3 meals per day left blank. Based on tags (breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert) users can add Trader's recipes in each meal dropdown and the program auto populates a grocery list for  the week with the estimated cost. Further, will display what their dietary intake would be daily or weekly. 

2) Based on tags or certain ingredients or filtering out allergens etc., the tool will recommend a recipe.
